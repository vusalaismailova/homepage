        <p>The Moon, a rock yearned for by sanity, spirit and outburst. The Moon, a <br> dream and—at the same time—a vital project. The Moon, for their <br> devotedness throughout more than 35 years innovating; obsessively<br> pursuing excellence from the land that saw their birth. The Moon as an <br> incessant journey, orbiting the world without ever leaving their <br> maternal home, their neighborhood, their people, their own <br> personalities. The Moon as an excuse not to stop learning and taking <br> risks. The Moon rising to the sky every night to make Earth dream.</p>

        <p class="normal">His first contact with wine dates back to the cellar of his parents’<br> inn. There, they say that he had the ability to fill up to 6 bottles of <br> wine at once.

    <h6>Creative Philosophy</h6>
    <p>Joan, Josep and Jordi. An equilateral triangle. Solid, liquid and<br> sweet. Cooking, wine and desserts. Three mirrors, each reflecting<br> its own personality, become a creative kaleidoscope in a set of <br>three-way mirrors generating rich, complex, colorful and<br> luminous compositions. A creative method born from a<br> philosophy that embraces external inspiration nurtured by<br> internal motivation.</p>
